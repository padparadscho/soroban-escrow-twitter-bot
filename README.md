# Soroban Escrow Twitter Bot

Twitter bot that monitors a specified Soroban escrow smart contract and automatically posts event notifications to Twitter.

## Overview

This bot listens for `lock` and `unlock` events emitted by the [Stronghold (SHx) escrow contract](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/contract/CCA5HAZCPEYXD7JBKAJCVUZUXAK7V5ZFU3QMJO33OJH2OHL3OGLS2P7M), formats informative tweets, and posts them to a configured [Twitter account](https://x.com/SHxEscrowAlerts).

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of `lock` and `unlock` events via Soroban RPC.
- Cursor-based pagination for reliable event tracking.
- Formatted tweets with contract balance and transaction details.
- Configurable polling intervals and dry-run mode for testing.

Track ongoing tasks and project progress through the [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/padparadscho/projects/4) board and participate in conversations or share your feedback in the dedicated [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/padparadscho/soroban-escrow-twitter-bot/discussions) space.
